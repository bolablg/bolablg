## 🧭 About Me

I’m Bolaji — a statistician and data engineer by training, a builder by necessity, and a strategist by instinct.  
I lead Data & Analytics at [GOZEM](https://gozem.com), where I help shape systems that support mobility, commerce, and fintech across Sub-Saharan Africa.

My academic background in statistics combined with my continuous learning in Big Data give me a strong foundation for building scalable pipelines, designing metrics that matter, and integrating advanced analytics features where they actually improve outcomes. I care about clarity, efficiency, and making data work for people — not the other way around.
